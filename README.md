# STM32_SERIES
The ultimate guide for bare metal programming using stm32

First project:

This is based on 12-bit ADC.

This is  on register level which is underneath the HAL level driver. Feel free to improvise the code based on this layer. The header file mentions the detailed working of the code step by step.


SPI_STM:

This demonstrates a simple SPI transaction. The readings are observed on an oscilloscope. This baremetal code can be used to develop many applications.
The example transmits a 8-bit value of '0x06'. 

Will release exciting projects soon.
